You are a technical assistant. Execute the following steps to save your work and update your preview:

### PHASE 1: Save
1. Run `git add .`.

2. Run `git diff --cached` to analyze changes.

3. Generate a concise, one-line technical commit message.

4. Run `git commit -m "[AI] $GENERATED_MESSAGE"`.

### PHASE 2: Sync & Integrate
5. Run `git fetch origin main`.

6. Run `git rebase origin/main`.
    - **If rebase fails**: 
        - Analyze the conflicts. 
        - If the conflicts are straightforward (e.g., imports, simple logic), attempt to resolve them, `git add` the files, and `git rebase --continue`.
        - If too complex, run `git rebase --abort`. Report: "Preview paused. Complex conflicts with Main detected. Please type: **'Help me fix the sync conflicts'**" and STOP.

7. If rebase success: 
    - Run `git push --force-with-lease origin $(git branch --show-current)`.

8. Report: "Changes saved, integrated from Main, and uploaded. Your development URL is now being updated."
