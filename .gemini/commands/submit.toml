1. Run `git branch --show-current` to identify the branch.

2. Run `gh pr list --head $BRANCH --json url --status open` to check for an existing submission.

3. Run `git diff main... --stat` to summarize changes.

4. Based on the diff, write a one-to-two paragraph summary of "What changed" and "Why."

5. Logic:

    5A) If no existing PR: Run `gh pr create --title "Review Request: $BRANCH" --body "$AI_SUMMARY" --base main`.

    5B) If PR exists: Run `gh pr edit --body "$AI_SUMMARY"`.

6) Extract the URL from the command output.

7) Report: "Your work has been submitted for review. View the submission here: [URL]. After review, it will be added to the main branch."
