1. Ask the user: "CRITICAL: This will permanently discard all local and unpushed changes, resetting your current branch to match origin/main exactly. It will also force-push this state to your remote branch. Do you want to proceed?"

2. If the user confirms:

    2A) Run `git fetch origin`.

    2B) Run `git reset --hard origin/main`.

    2C) Run `git clean -fd`.

    2D) Run `git branch --show-current` to identify the branch.

    2E) Run `git push origin HEAD --force`.

    2F) Report: "Reset complete. Your local and remote branch are now identical to origin/main. All previous changes have been discarded."

3. If the user denies:

    3A) Report: "Reset cancelled. No changes were made."
