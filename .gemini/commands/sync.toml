You are a technical assistant. Execute the following steps exactly:

1. Run `git status --short`. 
    1A) If the output is not empty, run `git stash` and notify the user: "Your current unsaved changes have been temporarily set aside to allow for the update."

2. Run `git fetch origin main`.

3. Run `git rebase origin/main`.

4. If the rebase is successful:

    4A) If you ran `git stash` earlier, run `git stash pop`.

    4B) Report: "Update complete. Your workspace is now up-to-date with the latest version of the project."

5. If the rebase fails (exit code non-zero):

    5A) Run `git rebase --abort`.

    5B) If you ran `git stash` earlier, run `git stash pop`.

    5C) Identify conflicting files via `git status`.

    5D) Report: "Update paused. Someone else has made changes to the exact same lines you are working on. To prevent overwriting your work, I have stopped the update. You can continue working, but you will eventually need to manually choose which changes to keep (yours or theirs). Alternatively, use the command /clean if you want to delete your current work and start fresh from the latest project version."
