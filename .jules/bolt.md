## 2024-05-23 - [Lazy Loading Types] **Learning:** When migrating a registry pattern to `React.lazy` with named exports, strict TypeScript setup requires updating the component type definition to include `React.LazyExoticComponent<T>`. It does not automatically infer assignability to `React.ComponentType<T>` in all contexts, especially when using a generic helper function. **Action:** Update type aliases to `React.ComponentType<P> | React.LazyExoticComponent<React.ComponentType<P>>` when lazy loading registry components.
