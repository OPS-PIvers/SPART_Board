## 2024-05-23 - [Widget Drag Optimization] **Learning:** Draggable widgets re-rendered their entire content on every pixel of movement because the parent passed a new `widget` object (with updated x/y). Standard `React.memo` failed because the `widget` prop reference changed. **Action:** Implemented a "stable content" pattern using `useRef` inside `useMemo` to return the _previous_ widget object reference if only x/y/z changed. Also wrapped lazy-loaded components in `React.memo` dynamically. Crucial exception made for widgets that spawn items relative to their own position (`catalyst`).
