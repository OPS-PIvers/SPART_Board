## 2026-02-03 - [Widget Drag Optimization] **Learning:** Draggable widgets re-rendered their entire content on every pixel of movement because the parent passed a new `widget` object (with updated x/y). Standard `React.memo` failed because the `widget` prop reference changed. **Action:** Implemented a `InnerWidgetRenderer` component wrapped in `React.memo` with a custom comparison function. This function checks relevant widget properties but intentionally ignores `x` and `y` coordinates for most widgets, preventing re-renders during drag. Exceptions are made for position-aware widgets (like `catalyst`) which must re-render on move.

## 2026-02-03 - [DraggableWindow Direct DOM Manipulation] **Learning:** Even with `InnerWidgetRenderer` memoization, the `DraggableWindow` itself (and `GlassCard`) was re-rendering on every mouse move, and crucially, `updateWidget` was triggering a global `DashboardProvider` update, causing _all_ widgets in `DashboardView` to reconcile. **Action:** Refactored `DraggableWindow` to use a `dragState` ref and direct DOM manipulation (`style.left`, `style.top`, etc.) for non-position-aware widgets during drag/resize. `updateWidget` is now only called on `pointerup`, eliminating global re-renders during drag.

## 2026-02-04 - [Scoreboard Item Re-renders] **Learning:** `React.memo` with default shallow comparison fails for list items when the parent component reconstructs item objects on every render (e.g., via `map` on a new config object from Firestore/State). This caused `ScoreboardItem` to re-render all teams whenever any team's score changed. **Action:** Implemented a custom equality check in `React.memo` for `ScoreboardItem` that compares primitive fields (`id`, `score`, etc.) instead of object references.
