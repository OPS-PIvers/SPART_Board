## 2026-02-03 - [Widget Drag Optimization] **Learning:** Draggable widgets re-rendered their entire content on every pixel of movement because the parent passed a new `widget` object (with updated x/y). Standard `React.memo` failed because the `widget` prop reference changed. **Action:** Implemented a `InnerWidgetRenderer` component wrapped in `React.memo` with a custom comparison function. This function checks relevant widget properties but intentionally ignores `x` and `y` coordinates for most widgets, preventing re-renders during drag. Exceptions are made for position-aware widgets (like `catalyst`) which must re-render on move.

## 2026-02-04 - [Direct DOM Manipulation for Drag] **Learning:** Even with `InnerWidgetRenderer` memoized, the parent `DraggableWindow` and `DashboardView` were re-rendering on every mouse move because `updateWidget` updated the global state. **Action:** Modified `DraggableWindow` to use direct DOM manipulation (`ref.style.left/top`) during drag for non-position-aware widgets, only committing the state update on `pointerUp`. This bypasses React's render cycle completely during the interaction.
