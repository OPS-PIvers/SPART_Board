## 2024-05-23 - Lazy Loading Widgets **Learning:** TypeScript's strict mode can be challenging when using `React.lazy` with named exports. The `LazyExoticComponent` type doesn't always align perfectly with `ComponentType` in strict checks, and the intermediate Promise result often results in `any`, triggering lint rules. **Action:** Use a helper function for named exports that handles the Promise resolution and explicitly casts the result to `React.LazyExoticComponent<React.ComponentType<any>>`, suppressing `no-explicit-any` where strictly necessary to satisfy the linter while maintaining runtime safety.
