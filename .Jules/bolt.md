## 2024-05-23 - Lazy Loading Widgets **Learning:** TypeScript's strict mode can be challenging when using `React.lazy` with named exports. The `LazyExoticComponent` type doesn't always align perfectly with `ComponentType` in strict checks, and the intermediate Promise result often results in `any`, triggering lint rules. **Action:** Use a helper function for named exports that handles the Promise resolution and explicitly casts the result to `React.LazyExoticComponent<React.ComponentType<any>>`, suppressing `no-explicit-any` where strictly necessary to satisfy the linter while maintaining runtime safety.

## 2024-05-23 - [Lazy Loading Types] **Learning:** When migrating a registry pattern to `React.lazy` with named exports, strict TypeScript setup requires updating the component type definition to include `React.LazyExoticComponent<T>`. It does not automatically infer assignability to `React.ComponentType<T>` in all contexts, especially when using a generic helper function. **Action:** Update type aliases to `React.ComponentType<P> | React.LazyExoticComponent<React.ComponentType<P>>` when lazy loading registry components.

## 2024-05-24 - [Global Hooks in List Items] **Learning:** Using global event listeners (like window resize) inside hooks consumed by list-rendered components (like `WidgetRenderer`) creates O(N) performance bottlenecks, as every item re-renders on every event. **Action:** Refactor hooks to accept an `enabled` flag or selector, allowing list items to opt-out of updates when they don't need the data (e.g., non-maximized widgets ignoring window size).
