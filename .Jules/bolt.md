## 2025-05-19 - Conditional useWindowSize for Performance **Learning:** In `WidgetRenderer`, `useWindowSize` was unconditionally adding a 'resize' listener and triggering re-renders for every widget instance on every window resize. By making `useWindowSize` accept an `enabled` parameter and passing `widget.maximized`, we avoided N re-renders (where N is widget count) for non-maximized widgets during resize operations. Student View uses `widget.w/h` props so it safely bypasses this hook as well. **Action:** When using hooks that listen to global events (like window resize/scroll), always consider adding an `enabled` or `active` condition to prevent unnecessary listeners and re-renders in list components.
