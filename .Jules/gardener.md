## 2024-05-23 - Refactor Sidebar and Extract SortableDashboardItem **Weed:** `Sidebar.tsx` was over 1400 lines and contained a large inner component definition (`SortableDashboardItem`) and duplicated background fetching logic found in `useBackgrounds`. **Root Cause:** Component grew organically as features were added (boards, backgrounds, widgets) without separating concerns. **Plan:** Extract sub-components and leverage existing hooks to reduce file size and improve readability/maintainability.
## 2025-05-27 - Refactor Dock and Extract Modals **Weed:** `Dock.tsx` was over 700 lines and contained multiple internal modal components (`WidgetLibrary`, `RenameFolderModal`). **Root Cause:** Features were added directly to the main file for convenience, leading to a "God Component". **Plan:** Extracted `WidgetLibrary` and `RenameFolderModal` to `components/layout/dock/` to reduce complexity and file size.
