## 2024-05-23 - Refactor Sidebar and Extract SortableDashboardItem **Weed:** `Sidebar.tsx` was over 1400 lines and contained a large inner component definition (`SortableDashboardItem`) and duplicated background fetching logic found in `useBackgrounds`. **Root Cause:** Component grew organically as features were added (boards, backgrounds, widgets) without separating concerns. **Plan:** Extract sub-components and leverage existing hooks to reduce file size and improve readability/maintainability.
