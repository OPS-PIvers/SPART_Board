## 2024-05-23 - Actionable Routines

**Insight:** Teachers currently use "Instructional Routines" as static text lists (e.g., "Step 1: Start Timer"). They must then mentally context-switch, locate the Timer widget in the dock, and drag it out. This disconnect between _instruction_ and _action_ creates friction and breaks the flow of the lesson.
**Concept:** **Actionable Routines**. Transform static steps into executable command centers. Allow teachers to "Attach" a widget to any step. When the step is reached, a single click launches the pre-configured tool (e.g., a Timer, a Random Picker, or a Work Symbol). This turns the routine widget into a "Lesson Remote Control," reducing navigation time by 90% and keeping the teacher focused on students, not software.

## 2024-05-24 - Smart Polls

**Insight:** Teachers often want to use polls for quick "Checks for Understanding" (CFUs), but the friction of typing out a question and 4 distractors during a live lesson is too high. This leads to them either skipping the check or using less effective verbal questions.
**Concept:** **Magic Poll Generator**. A "Sparkle" button in the Poll Settings that uses AI to instantly generate a relevant question and plausible options from a simple topic (e.g., "Photosynthesis" or "Civil War Causes"). This reduces creation time from 2 minutes to 5 seconds, making data-driven instruction effortless.
