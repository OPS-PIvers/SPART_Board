## 2024-05-23 - Actionable Routines

**Insight:** Teachers currently use "Instructional Routines" as static text lists (e.g., "Step 1: Start Timer"). They must then mentally context-switch, locate the Timer widget in the dock, and drag it out. This disconnect between _instruction_ and _action_ creates friction and breaks the flow of the lesson.
**Concept:** **Actionable Routines**. Transform static steps into executable command centers. Allow teachers to "Attach" a widget to any step. When the step is reached, a single click launches the pre-configured tool (e.g., a Timer, a Random Picker, or a Work Symbol). This turns the routine widget into a "Lesson Remote Control," reducing navigation time by 90% and keeping the teacher focused on students, not software.
