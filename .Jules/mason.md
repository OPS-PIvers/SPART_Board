## 2026-01-20 - [Missing CI for Functions] **Bottleneck:** Backend code (functions) is not validated in PRs, risking broken deployments. **Fix:** Migrated functions to pnpm and added parallel CI job for functions build in `pr-validation.yml`.

## 2026-01-26 - [Broken Production Deploy] **Bottleneck:** Production deployment workflow was only deploying Hosting and missing Functions build/deploy, leading to config drift and potential runtime errors. **Fix:** Updated `firebase-deploy.yml` to install function deps, build functions, and deploy all targets using `firebase-tools` with a service account.

## 2026-01-30 - [Build Scripts & Chunk Optimization] **Bottleneck:** Missing convenience scripts for full-stack build caused friction; large chunk warnings in build output. **Fix:** Added `install:all`, `build:all` scripts and optimized `vite.config.ts` manual chunks.

## 2026-02-02 - [Missing Backend Tests in CI] **Bottleneck:** Backend functions were not being tested in CI, leaving the codebase vulnerable to regression. **Fix:** Installed `vitest` in `functions`, configured `test:all` script to run both frontend and backend tests, and updated `pr-validation.yml` to enforce this check.
