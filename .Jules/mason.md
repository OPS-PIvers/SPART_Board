## 2026-01-20 - [Missing CI for Functions] **Bottleneck:** Backend code (functions) is not validated in PRs, risking broken deployments. **Fix:** Migrated functions to pnpm and added parallel CI job for functions build in `pr-validation.yml`.

## 2026-01-26 - [Broken Production Deploy] **Bottleneck:** Production deployment workflow was only deploying Hosting and missing Functions build/deploy, leading to config drift and potential runtime errors. **Fix:** Updated `firebase-deploy.yml` to install function deps, build functions, and deploy all targets using `firebase-tools` with a service account.

## 2026-02-05 - [Duplicate CI Logic] **Bottleneck:** `pr-validation.yml` was installing function dependencies twice in parallel jobs, consuming extra compute resources. **Fix:** Consolidated functions validation into the main `validate` job, ensuring single-pass installation and verification.
